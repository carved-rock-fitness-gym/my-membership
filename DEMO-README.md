# Carved Rock Fitness Linting Demo

This project demonstrates the problem with the current code quality tooling at Carved Rock Fitness.

## Current Issues

The current setup uses GitHub Actions workflows that automatically trigger whenever a pull request is opened or updated. The workflow runs ESLint for JavaScript files, configured with the company's custom ruleset.

When the linting tools identify issues, the automation creates new GitHub issues with standardized titles like "[LINT] Variable naming violation in user_profile.js" and labels them as "technical-debt". These issues include basic information such as the file path, line number, and a brief description of the violation generated by the linting tool.

## Demo Files

For this demo, we've added several files with intentional linting issues:

1. src/components/UserProfile.jsx - Has camelCase violations and unused variables
2. src/components/MembershipCard.jsx - Has quote style and indentation issues
3. src/components/WorkoutCard.jsx - Has line length issues and missing semicolons
4. src/features/FeatureClass.jsx - Has prop-types issues and unused state
5. src/services/ApiService.js - Has various linting issues including camelCase violations, console statements, and inconsistent quoting

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The demo includes a GitHub Actions workflow file at .github/workflows/code-quality-check.yml that will:

1. Run whenever a pull request is opened or updated
2. Run ESLint on all JavaScript files
3. Create GitHub issues for each linting violation
4. Assign issues to the developer who made the commit
5. Label issues as "technical-debt"

## Demo Scenario

When demonstrating this project, you can:

1. Show how the current workflow creates many small issues
2. Discuss how developers spend roughly 15% of their time addressing these issues
3. Explain how the descriptions are often too technical or vague
4. Show how context switching impacts productivity
5. Present your solution to these problems

## Next Steps (Post Demo)

After running this demo, you will need to:

1. Create feature branches
2. Open pull requests
3. Watch the GitHub Actions workflow create issues
4. Show how these issues impact developer productivity

## Rollback Instructions

To reset the demo environment, run the setup script with the -Rollback flag:

`powershell
./setup-demo.ps1 -Rollback
`

This will remove:
- Created GitHub issues
- Pull requests
- Feature branches
- Demo files with linting issues

The script will prompt for confirmation before each major action.
